A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. 

How firewalls filter traffic:
1. Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (e.g., the internet).
2. They examine network packets and decide whether to ALLOW or BLOCK them.
3. Filtering is done based on rules such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
4. Inbound rules control traffic coming into the system (e.g., block port 23).
5. Outbound rules control traffic leaving the system (e.g., allow web browsing).
6. Firewalls can be stateful (track active connections) or stateless (check only packet headers).
7. By blocking unnecessary or risky services (like Telnet), firewalls reduce attack surfaces.
8. By allowing only required traffic (like SSH), firewalls support secure remote access.

In short, firewalls filter traffic by allowing safe connections and blocking unauthorized or malicious ones.
